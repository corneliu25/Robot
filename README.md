Software for Control of Autonomous Robots Using Fuzzy Logic Controllers Tuned by Genetic Algorithms

This software implements the autonomous control of a robot by using a fuzzy logic controller tuned by a genetic algorithm.  The software was written in C programming language for Windows (SDK).   A description of the software can be found in the research publication "Arsene, C.T.C., & Zalzala, A.M.S., "Control of autonomous robots using fuzzy logic controllers tuned by genetic algorithms", In Proc Congress on Evolutionary Computation, Vol. 1, pp. 428-35, Washington DC, 1999, IEEE Computer Science Press, ISBN 0-7803-5536-9".    Possibly the software to be used also for simulation of Nano-robots.

The software was written in C (Windows SDK) for Windows 3.1 operating system and therefore needs to be compiled again in order to run. 

This software project has a DOI 10.5281/zenodo.572369.
